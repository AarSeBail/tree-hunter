# tree-hunter

A program for finding graphs with M edges which maximize the number of spanning trees possible.
Uses Monte-Carlo Tree Search to efficiently explore the search space.
This program is a successor to [tree-hugger](https://github.com/AarSeBail/tree-hugger/tree/master).

## Todo:
- Implement a default upper bound which is reasonably tight
